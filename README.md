This Shop page list the 4 different categories of clothing offered on this website: Jeans, T-Shirts, Hoodies, and Accessories.
Clicking a category tile will take you to the next pages showing the articles of clothing for that group. 
These pages will all have a filter button that reveals a dropdown when clicked. 
Here at this dropdown you are able to click different check boxes to filter the article of clothing by size and price.
Each clothing item tile will have the product name, price and size listed, along with an Add To Cart button.
Clicking this tile will also open up a modal that shows two full sized pictures of the product, a description, price, size, and an Add To Cart button.
